# Work in progress

# Blogging engine

This is a blogging engine I created as an [exercise](https://github.com/Applifting/fullstack-exercise) for [Applifting](https://applifting.io/), but I kind of strayed away from the technologies specified and used my favorite tech stack instead.

### Technologies used

- [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)
- [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc) - a tool for creating end-to-end type-safe APIs automatically, no manual type creation required.
- [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) - A next generation schema-first ORM that puts any other ORMs to shame.
- [TanStack (formerly React) Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query) - hooks that handle fetching, caching and updating asynchronous data - removing the need for state management in this app.
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) - a serverless MySQL database.
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) - for the best styling experience.

The app was created with the [T3 cli](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app)
